The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile technologies has radically reshaped modern computing, introducing both significant opportunities
and critical security challenges. IoT systems are now deeply embedded in smart homes, industrial control systems, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, making
them attractive targets for cyberattacks that exploit insecure communication protocols, firmware vulnerabilities, and misconfigured devices. At the same time,
mobile devices, powered by platforms such as Android and iOS, have become central to personal and enterprise security, handling sensitive data, authentication,
and financial transactions. As these devices increasingly serve as gateways to digital identities and critical services, securing apps, payment systems, authentication
mechanisms, and enterprise mobile management solutions has become a pressing concern.

The MIST workshop will explore the latest advancements in IoT and mobile security, focusing on the peculiar vulnerabilities and threats these systems face. Additionally, it will address how generative AI (genAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are influencing this space. These emerging technologies have the potential to enhance security by automating threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and response strategies. However, they also introduce new challenges, as they can be leveraged by attackers to craft sophisticated cyberattacks, bypass existing defenses, and exploit IoT and mobile system vulnerabilities.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
The goal of the MIST workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss the evolving security landscape of IoT and mobile systems. The workshop welcomes contributions on a broad range of topics related to securing these technologies, including novel attack vectors, defense mechanisms, risk assessments, and real-world case studies. In particular, we encourage discussions on the impact of generative AI and LLMs, both as tools for strengthening cybersecurity and as potential enablers of new attack strategies. This discussion will highlight the complexities and opportunities of integrating AI-driven solutions into security frameworks, with a particular focus on the implications these technologies have for the future of IoT and mobile system protection.
